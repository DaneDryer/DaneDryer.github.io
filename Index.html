 Hello I am Dane "Taco" Dryer, and I play for DarKTeamGG. I am a competitive Call of Duty player with zero experience with coding other than game design. 
 I have played Comp. COD for about 3-4 years and have been under many different orgs for the past 6-7 months. 
 I have finally found a team that has stayed somewhat to it's roster just changing the format of the players.
